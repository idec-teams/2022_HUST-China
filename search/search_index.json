Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans Sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) can catalyse the reduction of sulfide and the oxidation of quinone, which is widespread in living organisms. In the past 10 years, scientists have systematically studied the biological function of SQR in sulfide degradation and made remarkable progress.

SQR widely exists in almost all organisms except plants, including archaea, bacteria and human beings. In addition to primitive respiration, its functions include detoxification, heavy metal resistance, and regulating the balance of the signaling molecule hydrogen sulfide in living organisms. SQR can oxidize sulfide to sulfur with zero valence and transfer electrons to quinone through the prosthetic group FAD in order to reduce quinone to hydroquinone and eventually reaching desulfurization . In conclusion, SQR has great potential application values .With the aggravation of marine pollution, the sulfide content in sediments gradually increases. SQR is of great significance for the governance of environmental sulfur pollution. What\u2019s more,presently, hydroquinone, L-DOPA and other hydroquinone drugs are mainly produced by chemical synthesis methods, which will cause great pollution and high energy consumption. SQR can be used to inhibit the oxidation of hydroquinone in the future drug biosynthesis researches,which will optimize the synthesis routes. But the current thermal stability of SQR expressed by wild type is not high enough, the half-life is 30 minutes at the optimum temperature of 30\u2103. However, high temperature reaction conditions are often needed in industrial applications. On the one hand, the reaction at high temperatures can significantly reduce contamination of the reactants, while also increasing the solubility of the substrate and making it more accessible to the enzyme. On the other hand, it has been found that higher reaction temperature leads to higher reaction rate. Therefore, if the enzyme can maintain stable catalytic activity at high temperature, the corresponding transformation time can be shortened, and then the amount of enzyme required can be reduced, so as to reduce the production cost. As a result, we enhance the thermal stability of SQR by rational-designed point mutations and disulfide bonds in order to better adapt to industrial production conditions and to be produced in large amounts.","title":"Background"},{"location":"project/experimental_validation/","text":"Strategy: Experimental Validation Gene cloning, expression, and purification of SQR Insert the codon-optimized sqr gene. Mutations are introduced into the gene by whole-plasmid PCR. These mutant plasmids are transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. Then induce the strains to express SQR. The fermentation broth is harvested by centrifugation. The precipitated cells are resuspended by 10mM potassium phosphate buffer ,and then broken up by high-pressure homogenizer. Lysate cells and then load onto a nickel column. 50 mM PBS buffer containing 10 mM imidazole is used to eliminate other proteins, and 50 mM PBS buffer containing 100 mM imidazole is used to obtain pure SQR. At last, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is used to identify the molecular mass and purity of the recombinant enzyme. Measurement of apparent melting temperature(Tm) Tm is defined as the maximum of dRFU/dT. For each sample, mix 5 \u03bcL 100xSYPROTM Orange dye with 20 \u03bcL purified protein and centrifuge. Heat the sample from 25\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C at the speed of 1\u00b0C/min in the StepOnePlusTM real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) system to determine the Tm value. Enzyme activity determination We use the spectrophotometry to assay enzyme activity, which depends on the reduction of the absorbance at wavelength of 275nm caused by the reduction reaction of decylubiquinone (DUQ). The activity unit of the enzyme is defined as the amount of SQR required to reduce 1\u03bcmol of DUQ per minute.","title":"Experimental Validation"},{"location":"project/rational_design/","text":"Strategy: Rational Design Introduction 1. What is rational design? The rational protein design strategy is mainly based on site-directed mutagenesis and protein crystal diffraction technology . Bioinformatics or computer-aided methods are used to purposefully introduce new amino acids at specific sites, so as to modify specific properties of target proteins, such as thermal stability. This strategy is easy to conduct and it can save a lot of time. To minimize the selection workload and the randomness of the directed evolution technique, we apply this strategy to find those mutation sites. 2. How to design? By analyzing the crystal structure of enzyme, computer-aided design can predict the conformational stability of each amino acid residue in the target protein and the change of the free energy of unfolding of each mutant protein, so as to design the mutation sites that can potentially improve its thermal stability. The frequently-used software and programs are: SWISS -MODEL\uff1bDisulfide by Design\uff1bMODIP\uff1bMODELLER 9.9\uff1bGROMACS\uff1bB -FITTER\uff1bPyMol; ccp4\uff1bDiscovery Studio 3.5; ESyPred3D\uff1bESBRI\uff1blibSVM. 3. How do we select? In our experiment, we screen the mutation sites by predicting the effect of mutation on the free energy of unfolding of enzyme. \u0394\u0394G=\u0394G mutant \u2013\u0394G wild \u0394\u0394G\uff1athe effect of mutations on the free energy of unfolding(\u0394G) of protein molecules simulated by computer-aided analysis When \u0394\u0394G is less than zero , it indicates that the mutation could improve the thermal stability of the target protein , and the smaller the \u0394\u0394G mutation is, the better the thermal stability of the target protein, while when \u0394\u0394G value is greater than zero , it indicates that the mutation decreases the thermal stability of target protein . Point mutation 1. Screening of flexible sites Use GROMACS to calculate the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of each amino acid residue of SQR. Amino acid sites with high flexibility are selected. 2. Elimination of key sites Obtain evolutionarily conserved sites of proteins from ConSURF-DB. Collect the sequences with high similarity to the target sequences . And then perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) by MAFFT method. Calculate evolutionary conservation of each position, and then rank them on a scale of 1 to 9. Residues with a conserved rank greater than 8 are removed from the mutation library. Select residues within 5\u00c5 around the catalytic sites by PyMOl. Then eliminate the residues. 3. Energy change prediction of SQR mutation sites (1) Prediction by Rosetta Rosetta ddg_monomer predicts mutation sites that can potentially improve the thermal stability of the target protein through computing the change of folding free energy (\u0394\u0394G) of each mutant protein relative to the wild protein. Before computing, we need to minimize the three-dimension structure of the target protein in advance to reduce the interference of molecular collision in the process of protein unfolding. (2) Prediction by I-Mutant 2.0 Prediction can be made online directly on the website . By inputting amino acid sequences of target protein into the software,we can observe the change of the unfolding free energy (\u0394\u0394G value) of each mutant protein. Thus the positive and negative effects of the mutation site on the thermal stability of the protein can be measured by it. We comprehensively consider two methods to select suitable mutations. Disulfide bond 1. What is disulfide bond? The covalent bond formed by oxidation of the sulfhydryl groups of the two Cys side chains is called a disulfide bond. It is a high strength interaction force , which effects the stability of enzyme mainly depends on the entropy. 2. How to design a disulfide bond? We use three methods to design our disulfide bond. Disulfide by Design 2.0 (DbD2) predicts the potential amino acid residues on the assumption that all the residues mutate into Cys, and then it gives the potential residue pairs by assessing the steric configuration of the disulfide bond formed by each residue pair and calculating the \u03c73 torsion angle and the C\u03b1-C\u03b2-S\u03b3 angle of all residue pairs. MODIP estimates the sites of protein by using the conformation parameter of natural classic disulfide bond to build the staging hierarchy. BridgeD uses multiple protein structures to improve the flexibility of the protein skeleton, aiming to find the potential disulfide-bond-forming sites. Pool all the residue pairs that could form disulfide bonds predicted by these three methods together, and eliminate the above key sites, and calculate the \u0394\u0394G after mutation by Rosetta. For mutation combinations with \u0394\u0394G less than 0, PyMOL was used to observe whether the pairs of cysteine residues were matched after mutation. 3. What about the rest of the sulfhydryl groups? The formation of disulfide bond by sulfhydryl groups can increase the thermal stability of enzyme. However, the free sulfhydryl group is easy to be oxidized, which will have a negative effect on the thermal stability of enzyme. There are five cysteine residues in the sequence of SQR, with the sequence numbers of 128, 160, 226, 277, 356, respectively. 128, 160, 356 are important amino acid residues in the active site, while for the other two sites for cysteines, their sulfhydryl groups are free, which is not good for thermal stability. Therefore, the two cysteines are attempted to be mutated into other amino acids in the same way as the point mutation described above.","title":"Rational Design"},{"location":"project/results/","text":"Results Screening of flexible sites The RMSF of each amino acid residue of wild-type SQR protein (pdb ID: 3T31) was calculated by GROMACS at 298K and 333K, and selected the amino acid sites with higher \u0394RMSF and higher RMSF values at both temperatures. A total of 31 sites with high flexibility were screened. The first 10 residues in N-terminal and the last 10 residues in C-terminal have little effect on thermal stability, so we have deleted 4 residues of these kinds. Table 1. The position number of selected flexible residues Elimination of key sites ConSURF-DB was used to calculate the amino acid conservation of each site of SQR, and the sites with conservation values greater than or equal to 8 were screened out. PyMOL was used to screen out the amino acid residues within 5\u00c5 around H2S, FAD and decylubiquinone (DUQ). Table 2. The position number of conserved residues Table 3. Active Sites of SQR. Energy change prediction of SQR mutation sites We comprehensively consider the results of I-Mutant 2.0 and Rosetta ddg_monomer, and chose 30 suitable mutations. Amino acid residues located in loop structures are preferentially selected over those located in helix or sheet. Table 4. Selected mutations by I-Mutant 2.0 and Rosetta Design of disulfide bond The three tools predicted 189 pairs of potential residues that can form S-S bond if they were Cys. But only 9 of them have a minus \u0394\u0394G predicted by Rosetta ddg_monomer. For these 9 pairs, PyMOL was used for visual analysis to observe whether disulfide bonds were formed. The results showed that the nine groups of free cysteine residues were not matched in orientation and could not form disulfide bonds. There are a total of five cysteine residues in the SQR sequence, with serial numbers of 128,160, 226,277 and 356 respectively. Among them, 128,160,356 is an important amino acid residue in the active site, while for the other two, cysteine residues without disulfide bond are unfavorable to the stability of the enzyme. In the previous prediction of disulfide bond, amino acids that can form disulfide bond with cysteine 226,277 were not found, so we tried to mutate these two cysteines. Rosetta ddg_monomer was used to predict the free energy changes of cysteine 226, 277 to other 19 amino acids. Table 5. \u0394\u0394G of C to X mutations We chose the 277 residues which is in the loop structure, and select the C277V mutation. Expression and Purification We did enzyme fermentation and purification many times, but got strange results. Sometimes there were still many proteins left on the nickel column even after washed with 300 mM imidazole, but sometimes they had all been washed down after washed by 10 mM imidazole. Future Plan Now we have completed the construction of the bacteria and have rich experience in protein purification. We will perform mass spectrometry operation after October 10th to verify the identified bands, and then draw the enzyme activity curve to perform qpcr operation of the protein to measure the improvement of protein heat resistance. After that, we will screen the three mutations with the best effect and introduce the three mutations into the same bacterium to further improve the heat resistance of the protein. The experiment is expected to be carried out in mid-November. After that, we will calculate the enzyme activity again, and carry out the construction, fermentation, purification and determination of enzyme activity enhancement in the same way.","title":"Results"}]}
