Sulfur is the basic element of all life, and its lowest valence exists in the form of sulfide, which participates in many important physiological processes in life. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans Sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) can catalyse the reduction of sulfide and the oxidation of quinone, which is widespread in living organisms. In the past 10 years, scientists have systematically studied the biological function of SQR in sulfide degradation and made remarkable progress. It has potential application value in improving animal intestinal microenvironment, controlling animal pollution gas emission and the biosynthesis of some medicine with hydroquinone structure.

But the current thermo stability of SQR expressed by wild type is not high, the half-life is 30 minutes at the optimum temperature of 30Â°C. We enhanced the thermo stability of SQR by rational-design point mutations and disulfide bonds.
